IVE BEEN ALONE INSIDE MY MIND
YEAH I KNOW WHAT I FELT
KEPT ME DOWN

THOSE DAYS OF FEELING LONELY
EVER DRIFT AWAY FADING LINES
EVERY TIME THAT YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME

YEAH ALL I NEED IS
THE WAY THAT YOU LOVE ME
YEAH ALL I WANT IS ALL RIGHT HERE
AND ALL I FEAR IS TO BE WITHOUT YOU
MY SHINING LIGHT
YEAH IVE BEEN ON MY OWN MOST MY LIFE
ISOLATION BROUGHT ME DOWN EVERY TIME
MY DAYS OF FEELING LONELY
EVER DRIFT AWAY FADING LINES
EVERY TIME THAT YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME
I SEE THE LIGHT
YEAH ALL I NEED IS
THE WAY THAT YOU LOVE ME
YEAH ALL I WANT IS ALL RIGHT HERE
AND ALL I FEAR IS TO BE WITHOUT YOU
MY SHINING LIGHT
YEAH ALL I NEED IS

AND ALL I FEAR IS TO BE WITHOUT YOU
