PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT BABY
CAUSE IM BEGGIN
IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
SO PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT BABY
IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
SO PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT DARLING
RIDING HIGH
WHEN I WAS KING
I PLAYED IT HARD AND FAST
CAUSE I HAD EVERYTHING
I WALKED AWAY
BUT YOU WARNED ME THEN
BUT EASY COME
AND EASY GO
AND IT WOULD END
SO ANY TIME I BLEED
YOU LET ME GO
YEAH ANY TIME I FEED YOU
GET ME NO
ANY TIME I SEEK
YOU LET ME KNOW
BUT I PLAN AND SEE
JUST LET ME GO
IM ON MY KNEES WHEN IM BEGGIN
CAUSE I DONT WANT TO LOSE YOU
HEY YEAH RATATATA
CAUSE IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
AND PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT BABY
IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
AND PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT DARLING
I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
TRIED SO HARD TO BE YOUR MAN
THE KIND OF MAN YOU WANT IN THE END
ONLY THEN CAN I BEGIN TO LIVE AGAIN
AN EMPTY SHELL
I USED TO BE
THE SHADOW OF MY LIFE
WAS HANGING OVER ME
A BROKEN MAN
THAT I DONT KNOW
WONT EVEN STAND THE DEVILS
CHANCE TO WIN MY SOUL
WHAT WE DOING
WHAT WE CHASING
WHY THE BOTTOM
WHY THE BASEMENT
WHY WE GOT GOOD SHIT
DONT EMBRACE IT
WHY THE FEEL FOR
THE NEED TO REPLACE ME
YOURE THE WRONG WAY
TRACK FROM THE GOOD
I WANT TO PAINT A PICTURE
TELLING WHERE WE COULD BE AT
LIKE A HEART IN THE BEST WAY SHOULD
YOU CAN GIVE IT AWAY
YOU HAD AND YOU TOOK THE PAY
BUT I KEEP WALKING ON
KEEP OPENING DOORS
KEEP HOPING FOR
THAT THE DOOR IS YOURS
KEEP OHSO HOME
CAUSE I DONT WANNA
LIVE IN A BROKEN HOME
GIRL IM BEGGIN
MMM YEEEAH
IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
SO PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT BABY
IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
SO PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT DARLING
IM FIGHTING HARD TO HOLD MY OWN
JUST CANT MAKE IT ALL ALONE
IM HOLDING ON I CANT FALL BACK
IM JUST A CALM BOUT TO FADE TO BLACK
IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT BABY
IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
SO PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT DARLING
IM BEGGIN BEGGIN YOU
SO PUT YOUR LOVING HAND OUT BABY
